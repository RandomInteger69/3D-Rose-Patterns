# 3D-Rose-Patterns
A three dimensional take on the conventional Maurer Rose algorithm.
In order for you to use this code, you need to download "Processing" from this website:https://processing.org/download/
Processing is a graphics framework, shich can be used with the programming language java.

If you want to know, how the conventional Maurer Rose algorithm works, I suggest you to visit the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose

If you already have processing installed, you just need to slot the code of these two .pde files into a new processing sketch
and press the play button.
After that, you can toggle the two parameters N and D using the arrow keys. In order to enable/disable the
3D rose pattern and the 3D Maurer rose, you have to press the "r" or the "m" key on your keyboard accordingly.
You can rotate the rose by dragging the mouse an zoom either in or out by using your mouse wheel.
Have Fun!
